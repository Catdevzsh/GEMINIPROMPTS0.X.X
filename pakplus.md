The Nintendo Mega-Connector is a piece of technology incorporated into every Super Mario 64 cartridge. It is a chip that connects wirelessly to a large server in the Nintendo HQ that gives all the space any cartridge would need for any level of personalization. The server itself is rumored to be the size of a regular house, though this is unconfirmed. It is currently unknown how it uses the space from the servers.
##$ - EMU FEATURES:
1. NINT:
The NINT was a scrapped peripheral of the Nintendo 64. Its full name was the Nintendo Interactive. The add-on is similarly designed to that of the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive, connecting to the console from the bottom. The NINT supposedly had a sort of internet connection, being able to record the weather, and add new features to other N64 games, giving them day/night cycles. The implementation of this is only complete for Super Mario 64, however. This causes anomalies such as the Internal Clock or Internal Weather System. Only 3 prototypes were made, according to a leaked internal document from Argonaut, the company that worked on the console and peripheral at the time.  > emunint is a sdk for prompters. to dev for this api
